# Welcome to the Slutsky Lab fEPSP Repository!

Here you will find resources for recording *in vivo* field excitatory post synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and a MATLAB© based package for analysis of the recorded signals.

## Resources

- Stimulation protocols written for winWCP and Arduino
- A spreadsheet for easy localization of implant coordinates during surgery
- CAD files for printing and/or machining components designed for custom head fixation apparatus



## Analysis

### See the ExampleData directory for a full rundown of the package

### Pipeline

#### Before you begin
Prepare the raw data including times of stimulus onset.<br>

#### fepsp_org2traces
Organizes raw data according to stimulus protocol, number of channels, number of intensities, etc...<br>
Allows removing the trend (mean and slope) from individual traces.<br>
Outputs traces in a cell array. The format of traces if crucial for the rest of the pipeline.

#### fepsp_markings
GUI for manually marking the start and peak of each trace.<br>
The number of marker pairs is determined by the number of stimuli in a trace.<br>
Compensates for small inaccuracies in the manual markings by jittering in time the markers closer to the peak.<br>
Allows removal or inversion of individual traces. <br>
Provides easy navigation between all channels and intensities.<br>
In 'fast mode', only the highest intensity per channel will be presented by default.<br>
Saves markings as a struct with four cells: start and peak for individual and average traces.<br>
Updates traces according to the changes done in the GUI.<br>

#### fepsp_analyse
Calculate slope and amplitude for the individual and average traces.<br>
Allows user to determine the area for slope calculation.<br>
Outputs results as struct.

#### fepsp_summaryPlot
Summary plot of the results.<br>
Two variants of the main figure:
1. One for traces with a single stimulus (e.g. I/O; see figure below).
2. One for traces with multiple stimuli (e.g. STP).

### Notes
- The pipeline assumes each recording is in its own directory and will use the name of that directory when saving files. For example, if the recording is in a directory called */user/../mouse1_io1* then the output of fepsp_org2traces will be *mouse1_io1_traces.mat*
- For your convenience, all functions work with MATLAB's tab autocompletion.
- The analysis package is open software in accordance with the GNU General Public License v3.0.

### Requirements
